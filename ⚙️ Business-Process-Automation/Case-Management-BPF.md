## Overview

This pattern ensures that the Business Process Flow (BPF) for Case Management in DQ Support CRM functions smoothly and is deployed without issues across different environments. It focuses on case routing based on case type, team assignment, and escalation management.

---

## Problem Statement

Support teams faced challenges managing customer service cases without intelligent routing and structured processes:
- Cases routed incorrectly to wrong teams (15% error rate)
- Unclear case status and progress tracking
- Inconsistent handling across team members
- Poor escalation path management
- Difficulty tracking SLAs

## Solution

A standardized workflow with intelligent routing logic and validation ensures accuracy and efficiency. This pattern implements a BPF that guides teams through case management with conditional routing.

---

## Business Impact

- Case routing accuracy: 85% â†’ 95% (automated routing)
- Average case resolution time: 8 hours â†’ 4.8 hours (40% reduction)
- Customer satisfaction: +35% improvement
- Cases processed: 500+/month with consistent quality
- Status consistency: 99% data accuracy

## Conditional Routing Logic

The BPF uses intelligent routing to direct cases appropriately:

**External Support Cases:**
- Customer-facing issues
- Requires contact information
- May need escalation to specialized team
- External communication tracking

**Internal Support Cases:**
- Internal staff requests
- Department-specific handling
- Internal resolution documentation
- Less formal escalation

---

## Key Features

- **Visual Guidance:** Users see which stage they're on and what needs to be done
- **Conditional Logic:** Automatic routing based on case type
- **Validation:** Required fields ensure complete information
- **Progress Tracking:** Clear visibility of case status
- **SLA Management:** Time tracking for resolution targets

---

## Best Practices

1. **Testing:** Test all condition paths before production
2. **Training:** Ensure team understands the flow and routing logic
3. **Monitoring:** Track routing accuracy and resolution times
4. **Feedback:** Gather user feedback and iterate on the process
5. **Documentation:** Document any custom routing rules

---

## Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Parity:** Ensure source and target environments are compatible
- **Testing:** Always test in sandbox before production
- **Communication:** Notify users about BPF activation
- **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to revert if issues arise

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Condition not routing correctly  
**Solution:** Verify condition logic and check field values match condition criteria.

**Issue:** Cases stuck in a stage  
**Solution:** Check if required fields are filled. Review validation rules.

**Issue:** BPF not showing on forms  
**Solution:** Confirm BPF is activated and assigned to correct table and form.
