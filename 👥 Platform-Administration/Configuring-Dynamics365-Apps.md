## Context

**Tag:** Vertical Patterns | Power Platform Admin Center

**Application Use Case:**
- Configure and install Dynamics 365 apps in a Power Platform environment

**Reference Usage:** Setting up Dynamics 365 apps in Power Platform

---

## Story Behind The Pattern

### The Problem
Dynamics 365 apps in a Power Platform environment may be:
- Unconfigured or not installed
- Preventing users from accessing required functionality
- Not properly enabled for use
- Missing necessary configurations

### The Solution
Use the Power Platform Admin Center to configure existing Dynamics 365 apps, check their status, and install additional apps.

### Dependencies
- Power Platform Admin Center access
- Permissions to manage environments and Dynamics 365 apps

---

## The Pattern: Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Access the Power Platform Admin Center

1. Log in to the Power Platform Admin Center (admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) using your admin credentials
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage environments and Dynamics 365 apps

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Environments

1. Use the navigation menu on the left sidebar to go to the **Environments** section
2. Expand the **Environments** section to view sub-options such as:
   - Environment groups
   - Data policies
3. Select the environment where you want to configure Dynamics 365 apps
4. Example: **"DQ FACTORY - DFSA - Primary DEV"**

---

### Step 3: View Dynamics 365 Apps

1. In the main section of the selected environment, locate the **Dynamics 365 Apps** tab
2. This is often found under **"Resources"** or directly in the environment overview
3. Review the list of Dynamics 365 apps, which may include:
   - **Dynamics 365 for Sales**
   - **Dynamics 365 for Customer Service**
   - **Dynamics 365 Guides**
   - **Dynamics 365 HR Integration to URS**
   - Other organization-specific apps

4. Note the configuration status of each app (e.g., **"Enabled"** or **"Not Configured"**)

---

### Step 4: Check Configuration Status

Review the status of each app in the list:

**Status Types:**

- **Enabled:** The app is already configured and ready for use
  - Example: Dynamics 365 for Sales
  - Users can access the app immediately
  
- **Not Configured:** The app requires setup before it can be used
  - Example: Dynamics 365 HR Virtual Tables
  - Must be configured before user access

- **Installation Failed:** Previous installation attempt failed
  - Retry installation or troubleshoot

- **Pending:** Installation or configuration in progress
  - Wait for process to complete

Identify apps that need configuration or installation.

---

### Step 5: Configure an App

1. Select an app with a **"Not Configured"** status
2. Example: **Dynamics 365 HR Virtual Tables**
3. Click on the app name to open its configuration settings
4. Follow the on-screen instructions, which may include:

**Setup Steps:**

- **Setting up connections to data sources**
  - Connect to Dataverse
  - Connect to external systems
  
- **Defining data policies**
  - Access control
  - Data retention
  
- **Enabling specific features**
  - Enable virtual tables for HR data integration
  - Configure integration points
  - Set up data sync schedules

5. Complete all required fields and steps as prompted

---

### Step 6: Save and Apply Changes

1. After configuring the app, click **Save** to apply your changes
2. Verify that the app's status changes to **Enabled** in the Dynamics 365 Apps list
3. If the status does not update:
   - Revisit the configuration steps
   - Ensure all requirements are met (e.g., missing connections or permissions)
   - Check for validation errors

---

### Step 7: Navigate Using the Sidebar

Use the sidebar to access other sections for additional management tasks:

- **Home:** Return to the admin center overview
- **Resources:** Manage other environment resources
- **Analytics:** View usage and performance reports
- **Help + Support:** Access documentation or request support
- **Settings:** Adjust environment settings, such as security or policies

Use these sections to troubleshoot or explore related configurations if needed.

---

### Step 8: Complete Configuration

1. Repeat Steps 5-6 for all desired Dynamics 365 apps that need configuration
2. Once all apps are configured:
   - Click **Next** to proceed to the next task (e.g., user assignment or testing)
   - Or click **Done** if configuration is complete
3. If you need to cancel the configuration process at any point:
   - Click **Cancel** to discard changes

---

### Step 9: Install Dynamics 365 HR Integration to URS

1. From the Dynamics 365 Apps list, locate the **Dynamics 365 HR Integration to URS** app
2. Click the **Install** button to open the installation pop-up window
3. Review the package details in the pop-up:
   - **Name:** Dynamics 365 HR Integration to URS
   - **Version:** Note the version number (e.g., 1.0.0.0)
   - **Publisher:** Confirm the publisher (e.g., Microsoft)

4. Check the box to agree to the terms of service
5. Click **Install** to begin the installation process
6. Monitor the installation progress and wait for confirmation that the app is installed successfully

---

### Step 10: Test and Validate Configuration

After configuring or installing apps, test their functionality:

**For Configured Apps:**
- Log in as a user
- Verify access to features
- Example: For Dynamics 365 for Sales, test creating opportunities

**For Installed Apps:**
- Check if integration works as expected
- Example: For Dynamics 365 HR Integration to URS, verify virtual tables are accessible
- Test data synchronization
- Confirm HR data is properly integrated

If issues arise:
- Revisit the configuration or installation steps
- Troubleshoot (e.g., check for missing dependencies or incorrect settings)
- Review logs for error messages
- Contact Microsoft support if needed

## Configuration Best Practices

1. **Review Requirements:** Understand app requirements before configuring
2. **Plan Dependencies:** Ensure prerequisite apps are installed first
3. **Test in Sandbox:** Test in non-production environment first
4. **Document Configuration:** Record all configuration decisions
5. **Enable Features Gradually:** Enable features as needed, not all at once
6. **Monitor Performance:** Monitor app performance after configuration
7. **User Training:** Provide training before making apps available to users

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Configuration fails to save**
- Verify all required fields are completed
- Check for validation errors
- Ensure you have proper permissions
- Try again or contact support

**Issue: App status remains "Not Configured"**
- Complete all configuration steps
- Click Save explicitly
- Refresh the page
- Check for system errors

**Issue: Installation fails**
- Verify environment has sufficient capacity
- Check dependencies are met
- Review error message for specific issue
- Retry installation or contact support

**Issue: App not accessible to users after configuration**
- Verify users are assigned to environment
