## Context

**Tag:** Vertical Patterns | DevOps | Power Apps

**Application Use Case:**
- Split a monolithic solution (Invest UAE) into microservices for better scalability and management

**Reference Usage:** Setting up microservices by splitting and managing solution components

---

## Story Behind The Pattern

### The Problem
A monolithic solution (e.g., Invest UAE) is difficult to scale, maintain, and update due to its large, interdependent codebase:
- Deployment bottlenecks - any change requires full solution deployment
- Tightly coupled components creating cascading failures
- Difficulty isolating and testing individual features
- Version control conflicts across teams
- Inability to scale specific components independently
- High risk of breaking changes affecting entire system
- Increased time-to-market for new features
- Resource inefficiency

### The Solution
Split the monolithic solution into microservices (e.g., MOI_Solution_Choices, MOI_Solution_Processes, MOI_Solutions_Tables) to improve scalability, flexibility, and deployment efficiency.

### Dependencies
- Power Apps or Dynamics 365 environment
- Access to Solutions Explorer
- Matching components between source and target environments
- Internet connectivity for imports

---

## The Pattern: Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Make Sure You Have the Main Solution in Place

1. Log in to your Power Apps or Dynamics 365 environment
2. Navigate to the **Solutions** area in the Power Apps Maker Portal
3. Verify that the main solution, **"Invest UAE,"** is available and contains all the components (e.g., entities, processes, tables) you intend to split
4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to edit and export solutions
5. Document the components in the main solution:
   - Number of entities/tables
   - Number of processes
   - Number of choice sets/option sets
   - Total component count

---

### Step 2: Create the Target Solution Based on the Objects to Be Split

1. In the Solutions area, click **New** to create a new solution
2. Name the target solution (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Choices"** for choice components, **"MOI_Solution_Processes"** for processes, or **"MOI_Solutions_Tables"** for tables)
3. Provide:
   - **Publisher:** Select or create appropriate publisher
   - **Version:** V1.0 (or appropriate version number)
4. Save the solution
5. **Important Note:** The number of components in the objects of the main solution (Invest UAE) must match the number of components in the target environment to avoid mismatches

---

### Step 3: Go to the Target Solution and Add Components from the Main Solution

1. Open the target solution (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Choices"**)
2. Click **Add Existing** to add components from the **"Invest UAE"** solution
3. Use the dropdown menu to select the component type:
   - **"Choice"** for choice components
   - **"Table"** for entities/tables
   - **"Process"** for business process flows
   - **"Form"** for form components

---

### Step 4: Search for and Add a Specific Component

1. In the **"Add Existing"** dialog, search for the component present in the main solution
2. For example, search for **"Relationship Cardinality"** (a choice or relationship type)
3. Select the component and click **Add** to include it in the target solution (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Choices"**)
4. Repeat this process for other components of the same type as needed

---

### Step 5: Add Processes from the Monolithic Solution to the Split Process Solution

1. Open the target split solution for processes (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Processes"**)
2. Click **Add Existing** and select the **"Process"** component type from the dropdown
3. Search for a specific process, such as **"Facilitation Case,"** and click **Add** to include it in the split solution
4. Continue adding all relevant processes

---

### Step 6: Verify the Process and Associated Table

1. After adding a process (e.g., **"Case to Resolution"**), verify that it appears in the **"MOI_Solution_Processes"** solution
2. Note that the process may automatically include its associated table (e.g., **"Case to Resolution"** table) due to dependencies
3. **Reason:** Processes come with their own tables for:
   - Isolation - processes don't interfere with other components
   - Modularity - each process is self-contained
   - Data integrity - independent operation
   - Maintainability - easier to update individual processes

---

### Step 7: Add Tables from the Monolithic Solution to the Split Table Solution

1. Open the target split solution for tables (e.g., **"MOI_Solutions_Tables"**)
2. Click **Add Existing** and select the **"Table"** component type
3. Search for the desired table (e.g., a table related to **"Invest UAE"**) and click **Next**

---

### Step 8: Include All Objects for the Table

1. In the **"Add Existing"** dialog, check the box for **Include all objects**
2. This ensures comprehensive inclusion of:
   - Related components
   - Consistency across environments
   - Simplifies management
   - Includes entity metadata for full functionality
3. Click **Add** to finalize the table addition

---

### Step 9: Export Solution from Development

1. In the Solutions area, select the split solution (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Choices"**)
2. Click **Export**
3. Choose **Unmanaged** (provides flexibility in target environment)
4. Download the .zip file
5. Keep the file for deployment to other environments

---

### Step 10: Import to Target Environment

1. In the target environment, go to **Solutions**
2. Click **Import**
3. Select the exported .zip file
4. Follow the import wizard:
   - Review solution details
   - Resolve any dependency issues
   - Map any references if needed
5. Complete the import process
6. Click **Publish all customizations**

## Key Concepts

**Microservices Architecture:**
Breaking monolithic applications into smaller, independently deployable services that can be scaled and maintained separately.

**Solution Dependency:**
Component in one solution that relies on component in another solution. Must be deployed in correct order.

**Component Type:**
Category of Power Apps component (Process, Entity, Form, Choice, etc.). Each type is managed separately.

**Managed vs Unmanaged:**
- **Unmanaged:** Can be edited and customized in target environment
- **Managed:** Read-only in target environment; must update via new import

---

## Best Practices

1. **Component Count Matching:** Ensure source and target environments have matching component counts to avoid deployment mismatches
2. **Dependency Awareness:** Processes include their own tables automatically - plan accordingly
3. **"Include All Objects":** When migrating tables, always include all related objects for completeness
4. **Testing Strategy:** Test each microservice independently before integration
5. **Documentation:** Document component ownership and dependencies
6. **Version Control:** Use semantic versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc.)
7. **Deployment Order:** Deploy in order: Tables → Choices → Processes

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Component count mismatch between environments**
- Verify component count in source before export
- Check component count in target before import
- Add missing components to match counts
- Run validation before deployment

**Issue: Dependency errors during import**
- Ensure source solution dependencies are resolved
- Deploy dependent solutions first
- Check component references are valid
- Review deployment order

**Issue: Process not functioning after split**
- Verify process table was included in deployment
- Check process triggers and conditions
- Test process in isolation
- Review related tables are available

**Issue: Forms not displaying correctly**
- Ensure all related tables are deployed
- Check form security settings
- Verify form references are valid
- Test in target environment
