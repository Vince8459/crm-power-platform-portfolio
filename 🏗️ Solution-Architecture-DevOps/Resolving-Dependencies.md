## Context

**Tag:** Vertical Patterns | DevOps | Power Apps

**Application Use Case:**
- Resolve missing dependencies to ensure smooth solution deployment

**Reference Usage:** Managing and resolving dependencies in Power Apps or Dynamics 365

---

## Story Behind The Pattern

### The Problem
Missing dependencies in a solution (e.g., missing entities or attributes) cause deployment failures or runtime errors in Power Apps:
- Solution fails to import due to missing components
- Runtime errors when dependent component not available
- Difficult to identify which components are missing
- Deployment blocked until dependencies resolved
- Time-consuming troubleshooting

### The Solution
Identify and resolve missing dependencies by ensuring all required components are present and active in the target environment.

### Dependencies
- Power Apps or Dynamics 365 environment
- Access to Solutions Explorer
- Internet connectivity for importing solutions
- Permissions to manage solutions

---

## The Pattern: Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Understand Dependencies

A **"dependent"** is a component (e.g., an entity, field, or process) that relies on another component to function correctly.

A **"missing dependency"** occurs when a required component is absent in the target environment, leading to errors. For example:

**Missing Dependency Example 1:**
- The **"incident"** entity (Type="1", displayName="Case")
- Requires the **"moi_investmentagreementcase"** entity (Type="1", displayName="Investment Agreement Case")
- If "moi_investmentagreementcase" doesn't exist in target, deployment fails

**Missing Dependency Example 2:**
- The **"incident"** entity's **"moi_processtype"** field (Type="2", displayName="Process Type")
- Requires the **"moi_processtype"** choice (Type="9", displayName="Process Type")
- If the choice doesn't exist, field cannot be created

**Missing Dependency Example 3:**
- The **"Lead to Opportunity Sales Process"** process
- Requires the **"Initial Meeting Conducted"** table
- If table is missing, process cannot function

---

### Step 2: Identify the Solution Component EntityType

1. Navigate to the **Power Apps** or **Dynamics 365** environment
2. Go to the **Solutions** area in the Power Apps Maker Portal
3. Select the solution you are working with (e.g., **"Invest UAE"** or a split solution like **"MOI_Solutions_Tables"**)
4. View the solution components list, which includes:
   - Entities
   - Fields
   - Forms
   - Views
   - Processes
   - Choice Sets
   - etc.

5. Identify the **componenttype** attribute for each component (an integer representing the type):

**Common Component Types:**
- **1:** Entity (Table)
- **2:** Attribute (Field)
- **3:** Relationship
- **9:** Choice (Option Set)
- **24:** Form
- **60:** System Form
- **61:** Web Resource
- **62:** Site Map
- **63:** Connection Role
- **70:** Field Security Profile
- **91:** Plugin Assembly
- **92:** SDK Message Processing Step

---

### Step 3: Identify Missing Dependencies

1. Review the solution manifest or error messages for missing dependencies
2. Look for error messages indicating:
   - **"Entity not found"** - Missing table
   - **"Attribute not found"** - Missing field
   - **"Process requires..."** - Missing related component
   - **"Cannot resolve dependency"** - Generic dependency issue

**Example Errors:**

Error 1:
- **"The incident entity (Type="1") is missing the required moi_investmentagreementcase entity (Type="1")"**

Error 2:
- **"The incident entity's moi_processtype field (Type="2") is missing the required moi_processtype choice (Type="9")"**

Error 3:
- **"The 'Lead to Opportunity Sales Process' process is missing the 'Initial Meeting Conducted' table"**

---

### Step 4: Check Existing Components in the Target Environment

1. Navigate to the **Solution Explorer** in the target environment (e.g., **"Invest UAE DEV A"**)
2. Look for the split solution (e.g., **"MOI_Solutions_Tables"** or **"MOI_Solution_Processes"**)
3. Check if the required components (e.g., **"moi_investmentagreementcase"** entity, **"moi_processtype"** choice, **"Initial Meeting Conducted"** table) are present and active
4. Note which components are missing or inactive

---

### Step 5: Import Required Solutions

1. If a required component is missing (e.g., **"moi_investmentagreementcase"** entity), locate the solution that contains this component (e.g., the **"Active"** solution)
2. Import the solution into the target environment:
   - Go to the **Solutions** area
   - Click **Import**
   - Select the solution file containing the missing component
   - Follow the import wizard to complete the process

3. After importing, **publish all customizations**:
   - Click **Publish All Customizations**
   - Wait for the publishing to complete
   - Ensure the components are now available

---

### Step 6: Verify Component States

1. Ensure the imported components (e.g., **"moi_investmentagreementcase"** entity, **"moi_processtype"** choice) are in an **active state**
2. If a component is **inactive**:
   - Select it in the **Solution Explorer**
   - Click **Activate**
   - Confirm the activation

3. Re-test the solution deployment to verify the dependency is resolved

---

### Step 7: Handle Specific Missing Dependencies

**Example: "Initial Meeting Conducted" Table Missing**

For the **"Lead to Opportunity Sales Process"** process missing the **"Initial Meeting Conducted"** table:

1. Go to the split solution containing processes (e.g., **"MOI_Solution_Processes"**)
2. Click **Add Existing**
3. Select **"Table"**
4. Search for **"Initial Meeting Conducted"**
5. Check **Include all objects** to ensure all related components are added
6. Click **Add**
7. Verify the table is now present and active in the target environment

---

### Step 8: Validate Dependency Resolution

1. **Re-deploy** the solution and check for dependency errors
2. If errors persist:
   - Revisit the solution manifest for additional missing dependencies
   - Repeat the import/activation process for remaining missing components
3. **Monitor logs** or **error messages** to ensure all dependencies are resolved
4. Test the solution functionality to confirm all components work correctly

## Dependency Resolution Workflow

```
[DEPLOYMENT FAILS]
    â†“
[ERROR: Missing Dependency]
    â†“
[IDENTIFY MISSING COMPONENT]
    - Review error message
    - Identify component type
    - Identify component name
    â†“
[CHECK TARGET ENVIRONMENT]
    - Search for component
    - Verify if present
    - Check if active
    â†“
[COMPONENT FOUND & ACTIVE]
    â””â”€â†’ Move to next dependency
    
[COMPONENT FOUND BUT INACTIVE]
    â”œâ”€â†’ Activate component
    â””â”€â†’ Retry deployment
    
[COMPONENT NOT FOUND]
    â”œâ”€â†’ Locate source solution
    â”œâ”€â†’ Import containing solution
    â”œâ”€â†’ Publish customizations
    â”œâ”€â†’ Verify component active
    â””â”€â†’ Retry deployment
    â†“

## Dependency Types

### Entity/Table Dependencies
```
Process depends on Entity
    â”œâ”€ Process requires table to exist
    â”œâ”€ All fields must be present
    â””â”€ Relationship must be configured
```

### Field Dependencies
```
Form depends on Field
    â”œâ”€ Field must exist on table
    â”œâ”€ Field must have correct type
    â””â”€ Field must be active
```

### Choice/Option Set Dependencies
```
Field depends on Choice
    â”œâ”€ Choice must exist
    â”œâ”€ All options must be defined
    â””â”€ Choice must be active
```

### Relationship Dependencies
```
Form depends on Relationship
    â”œâ”€ Relationship must exist
    â”œâ”€ Parent and child tables must exist
    â””â”€ Relationship must be active
```

## Best Practices

1. **Map Dependencies:** Document all component dependencies before deployment
2. **Deploy in Order:** Deploy solutions with fewer dependencies first
3. **Test Each Layer:** Verify each dependency layer before moving to next
4. **Use Solution Checker:** Run solution checker to identify dependencies early
5. **Version Control:** Track which components are in which solutions
6. **Automation:** Automate dependency validation where possible
7. **Documentation:** Document dependency resolution steps for team

## Common Dependency Issues

**Issue 1: Circular Dependencies**
- Solution A depends on B, B depends on A
- **Solution:** Restructure to eliminate circular dependency

**Issue 2: Deep Dependency Chains**
- A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D â†’ E
- **Solution:** Flatten hierarchy to reduce deployment complexity

**Issue 3: Undocumented Dependencies**
- Component depends on undocumented external solution
- **Solution:** Use solution checker; document all dependencies

**Issue 4: Inactive Dependencies**
- Required component exists but is inactive
- **Solution:** Activate component before deployment

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Entity not found" error**
- Verify entity exists in target environment
- Check entity is active and published
- Import solution containing entity if missing
- Verify entity name spelling and case

**Issue: "Attribute not found" error**
- Verify field exists on table in target
- Confirm field is active
- Check field logical name matches exactly
- Review field type compatibility

**Issue: "Choice not found" error**
- Verify choice set exists in target
- Confirm choice is global (not local to field)
- Check choice name and values
- Import solution containing choice if missing

**Issue: "Cannot resolve dependency" error**
- Review complete error message
- Identify exact missing component
- Search for component in all solutions
- Import containing solution
- Verify component is active before retry
