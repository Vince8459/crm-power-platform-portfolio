## Story Behind The Pattern

### The Problem

**Scenario 1:**
- Field with file attachment types isn't visible unless a record is created
- This is an issue when the user is creating a record in 3D matrix in the create basic form
- The user needs to create the records first and then edit it to be able to upload file
- Or the upload file is excluded from the 3D matrix

### The Solution
- Utilise the note options from the basic form meta data
- Use the note meta data to upload files

### Dependencies
N/A

## The Pattern: Implementation Method

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
**Sequence is important!**

---

## Step 1: Enable Attachments for the Table

1. Go to **make.powerapps.com**
2. Select the **3D matrix (subgrid table)**
3. Go to **table properties**
4. Select **Enable Attachment** from the option below
5. **Save and sync**

---

## Step 2: Add Timeline Component to the Basic Form

1. Navigate to the basic form linked to the subgrid table
2. In the form designer, add a new component
3. Select **Timeline component**
4. Configure timeline to display:
   - Notes (Annotations)
   - Activities
   - Attachments
5. Save and publish the form

---

## Step 3: Configure the Note Meta Data

1. Go to the **subgrid basic form**
2. Go to **basic form meta data**
3. Add new meta data:
   - Click **"New basic form metadata"**
4. Update the form with the following values:
   - **Type:** Select **Attribute**
   - **Attribute Logical Name:** Select the Signature column (or file upload field)
   - **Control Style:** Select **Code Component**

5. Ensure the notes options are filled as following, especially the highlighted ones:
   - **Type:** Attribute
   - **Attribute Logical Name:** [Select your file field]
   - **Control Name:** [Leave default or specify]
   - **Control Style:** Code Component

6. **Save and close**

---

## Step 4: On the Basic Form Additional Settings Enable the Following Settings

1. Open the basic form in Power Pages Management
2. Go to **Additional Settings**
3. Enable the following checkboxes:
   - **Enable Attachment Sync**
   - **Allow file uploads in notes**
   - **Show attachments section**
4. Configure attachment settings:
   - Maximum file size
   - Allowed file types
   - Storage location

---

## Step 5: Configure Table Permissions - Subgrid Table Permissions

1. Go to **Power Pages Management**
2. Go to **table permissions** under security
3. Create the **subgrid table permission** from the new option:
   - Click **"New Table Permission"**

4. Fill the following info:
   - **Name:** Mainform_Subgridform
   - **Table Name:** select the subgrid table from the dropdown list
   - **Website:** select the active website from the lookup search
   - **Access Type:** Parent

5. Fill the **Parent Access Type** details:
   - **Parent Table Permission:** the main table that include the main form that has the 3D matrix question
   - **Parent Relationship:** select the column from dropdown list

6. Select the **privileges options** as following:
   - Select all privileges:
     - Read
     - Write
     - Create
     - Delete
     - Append
     - Append To

7. **Save and sync**

---

## Step 6: Configure the Note (Annotation) Permissions

1. Add **new table permission**
2. Fill the following info:
   - **Name:** MainFrom_SubgridFormNotes
   - **Table name:** select **Notes (annotation)** from the dropdown list
   - **Website:** select the target website
   - **Access Type:** Parent

3. Fill the **Parent Access Type Details:**
   - **Parent table permission:** subgrid table
   - **Parent relationship:** select the item from dropdown list

4. Select the **privileges as following:**
   - Select all:
     - Read
     - Write
     - Create
     - Delete
     - Append
     - Append To

5. **Save and sync**

## File Upload Implementation Flow

```
User opens 3D Matrix Form
    â†“
Clicks to Create New Child Record
    â†“
Basic CREATE Form Opens
    â†“
[Timeline Component with Notes Section]
    â”œâ”€ Shows note input area
    â”œâ”€ Provides file attachment button
    â””â”€ Allows inline file uploads
    â†“
User Uploads File via Notes
    â†“
File Stored in Annotations Table
    â†“
Timeline Shows File Attachment
    â†“
Record Created Successfully with File
    â†“
Subgrid Displays Record with Attachment Icon
```

---

## Key Concepts

**Annotations (Notes):**
System table that stores notes and attachments associated with records. Using annotations allows file uploads without needing a separate file attachment field.

**Timeline Component:**
Displays notes, activities, and attachments in chronological order. Provides user-friendly interface for viewing and adding attachments.

**Table Permissions:**
Control who can access what data. Parent-type permissions inherit permissions from parent record.

**Metadata Configuration:**
Defines how form fields are rendered and behave in Power Pages. Control Style "Code Component" enables special functionality.

---

## Configuration Details

### Attachment Metadata Configuration
```
Type: Attribute
Attribute Logical Name: [Your file field - or use notes]
Control Style: Code Component
Required: No
Visible: Yes
```

### Parent Table Permission Structure
```
Main Table (Parent)
    â†“ 1:N Relationship
Subgrid Table (Child)
    â†“ Links to
Notes/Annotations Table (File storage)
```

### Permission Hierarchy
```
MainForm_Subgridform (Parent permission for child table)
    â”œâ”€ Privileges: Read, Write, Create, Delete, Append
    â””â”€ Links to
        MainFrom_SubgridFormNotes (Annotation permission)
            â””â”€ Privileges: Read, Write, Create, Delete, Append
```

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Table Attachments First:** Must enable attachments on table before configuring in portal
2. **Use Notes for Files:** Notes/Annotations are more reliable than direct file attachment fields
3. **Configure Permissions Correctly:** Ensure both child table and annotation table permissions are set
4. **Test File Types:** Verify allowed file types are appropriate for use case
5. **Set File Size Limits:** Protect storage by setting reasonable file size restrictions
6. **Sequence Matters:** Follow the implementation steps in exact order
7. **Sync After Changes:** Always sync portal configuration after making changes

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: File upload button not appearing**
- Verify table attachment is enabled
- Check timeline component is added to form
- Confirm metadata is configured with Code Component style
- Ensure annotation permissions are set correctly

**Issue: Users cannot upload files**
- Review table permissions on subgrid table
- Verify annotation (notes) permissions are configured
- Check "Allow file uploads in notes" is enabled
- Confirm user has append permission on notes table

**Issue: Files not appearing after upload**
- Verify sync was performed after configuration changes
- Check that timeline component is visible on form
- Confirm annotation permissions include read privilege
- Test with different browser to rule out caching

**Issue: "Unable to upload" error**
- Check file size is within limits
- Verify file type is allowed
- Confirm storage quota is not exceeded
- Review Power Pages logs for detailed error
